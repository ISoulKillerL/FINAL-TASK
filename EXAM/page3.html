      <h1>Drawing</h1>
      <p>
        I love all kinds of drawing — whether it’s gouache, crayons, pencil, pen, or markers! What’s really interesting is that I never formally studied art or took lessons. Instead, I taught myself by watching tutorials and learning the techniques needed to become a true professional in this craft.

        Recently, I created a drawing using only two crayons — black and white! This limited palette was an incredibly exciting challenge for me. It pushed me to sharpen my skills in adding contrast, shading, and highlights without relying on colors. This experience helped me better understand the nuances of light and shadow, and how they can bring a simple image to life.

        Drawing for me is more than just putting lines on paper — it’s a way to express emotions, capture moments, and explore creativity in its purest form. Every sketch, no matter how simple, is a step forward in my artistic journey, and I’m constantly inspired to improve and experiment with new styles and tools.
