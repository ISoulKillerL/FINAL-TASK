      <h1>Video Editing</h1>
      <p>
        I started exploring video editing about two years ago, and since then it has become one of my favorite creative outlets. Over time, I’ve gained experience using powerful tools like Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, which have allowed me to bring my ideas to life in a dynamic and visually engaging way.

        Throughout this journey, I’ve worked on a variety of projects—from editing entire series of episodes to crafting short, stylish edits inspired by my favorite anime. Each project has helped me develop my skills in storytelling, timing, and visual effects, pushing me to experiment with different techniques and styles.

        Video editing is not just about cutting clips together; it’s about creating a mood, telling a story, and connecting with an audience emotionally. I love how this art form combines creativity with technical skills, allowing me to transform raw footage into polished, captivating content.

        Here’s a sample of my work — I hope it gives you a glimpse into my passion and dedication to video editing!
