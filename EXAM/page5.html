        <h1>Basketball</h1>
        <p>
          Basketball has been a big part of my life for the past two years. I trained regularly, developed both my offensive and defensive skills, and even helped my school team earn 2nd place in a school tournament — a moment I'm really proud of.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve always had strong ambition and drive on the court. I’m quick on my feet, read the game well, and know how to defend and push forward when it matters. While my shooting still needs work, I see it not as a weakness, but as a challenge — something to improve and turn into a strength with time and dedication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basketball taught me discipline, teamwork, and the value of never giving up, no matter the score. And I’m not stopping here — my journey is just getting started.
